<p class="ff-amsiprobold">Professional history</p>
<p> My first job was in the materials science department at UNT testing interatomic models for MgLi. After graduating TAMS I spent three years working for Red Bull while attending UTDallas. Before graduating with my Marketing BS in 2013 I was working full-time for Texas liquor giant Goody Goody managing their promotions and ad agency Tracey Locke. I have worked as the director of marketing for a boutique web services startup, marketing campaigns manager for a team print shop taking their services online while building cloud inventory. I most recently worked on geo-targeted mobile ads with yp marketing solutions.</p>

Summary - <strong>C</strong>ommunity <strong>M</strong>arketing <strong>M</strong>anager Boulder
</h2>
<p>
You want me as the Boulder CMM because I have three years of local territory marketing experience with an international brand and event production a-team and have academic background that matches your ethos. To launch a new vertical for an apparel company I implemented a three sixty product viewer with models on html5 landing pages. For goody goody I implemented 25,000+ loyalty cards into a content driven email campaign. Every marketing hat from public relations to guerilla, I have likely worn in the past six years. My event production and media experience would be particularly handy in showing the power of a passion for development. 
</p>
<p>
The wrong person in this role starts their quarterly report with lead conversion metrics and ends on job placement rates. The success of dev bootcamp graduates is the start and end of a camp's success. As a community manager I can build pipelines to recruit students who will succeed in your model and pushing them to their potential. I am a compulsive leader with an emphasis on loyalty. My teammates and coworkers count on me to do whatever work is necessary, because not believing your team can get it accomplished is a terrible way to compete. If you think my skillset matches, I would love to talk more about the CMM position in Boulder. Thanks for taking a look at my background.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><small>(Requirements)</small> &amp; responses</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
<li><Strong>
Build strong relationships w/ tech companies, investors, institutions, spaces, press, and mavens.</strong><br>
In Red Bull our strategy was similiar, you look for opinion leaders that the community follows. I can give you contacts that will come out to an event for me in Dallas from every major print outlet and university without a budget. If you have the budget you can get anyone you want to show up and we can have that type of impact to kickoff Boulder.
<br>
Event hosting creates a space where new connections form under your brand umbrella. I have worked thirty thousand person events and week long setups, driven questlove to a set, and conducted one on one in-depth artist interviews for radio stations. If you take ownership of curation then the scene will reward your presence in the market. Give me a shot and I can get you major market coverage, I have the experience to coordinate the rollout and the creativity to make your approach stand out.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Secure new applications, this is a business after all.</strong><br>My theory is if every piece of the customer journey goes correctly it will be our role to focus on selecting the right applicants. Meeting new students starts by making sure every other part of the machine operates correctly. Conversion rates matter to me as a marketing systems engineer and I can present coherently on web analytics and what a meaningful impression looks like in a twenty first century screen environment. If you want to make sure the end to end pipeline works correctly, I have experience in Salesforce, Google for Business, and a flurry of startup size crms.
</li>
<li><strong>
Get in touch with community stakeholders and put our development resources to work making a difference through technology and empathy. </strong><br>There is interest in these languages from children to grandparents, board rooms to break rooms, and ditching bias means engaging in each of those conversations on their own terms. I like putting new pieces together, and events create that space. I can picture dev bootcamp becoming a locally known name and resource, based on the model for EDTX, the largest earth day event in the country.
</li>
<li><strong>
Generate content for the DBC. I have boatloads of work experience here. </strong><br>I have been the personal content generator for major retailers, written copy for full backpage placements, blogged on medical knowledge for hospitals, and could probably get street cred from a social media senior director in Austin, which is a galactic phenomena unobservable on twitter. My current focus is on content syndication and video/gif making. If you are ambitious we can talk strategies on how to move on the online tutorial pipeline, or how we can better localize online interest through events and online media purchasing. I have been in all of these meetings before. 
</li>
<li>
<strong>Alumni databasing the area is the worst way of saying keep in touch with graduates I have ever heard.</strong> <br> As CMM in this program the graduates will have a reliable network which makes them feel more connected and not isolated. The amount of stress and effort put into completing this education will form bonds and our role as educators is to give those bonds a meaningful home.<br>My high school alumni, Texas Academy of Math and Science, has graduates in every top graduate school in the country, working as doctors in top hospitals and writing code for top companies. When you talk of a bootcamp culture, I remember what we went through to find success. Two days before walking for graduation three kids got expelled for drinking after their last final. Commeraderie required sacrifice. <br>The power of your lasting network is who will grab lunch with you off of a phone call and make a decision based off dinner. I want to build a culture of influence, a network integrated into the Colorado tech scene, based around top quality dev bootstrap graduates and meaningful employment.
<br><a name="Experience"><br></a>
</li>
<li>
Last requirement was matching the company's ethics. I am not at all worried about my personal ethics. Some of your student feedback seems less positive of your corporate whole self since Kaplin's involvement, and I want to know I can speak my mind about the experience of each person our academy reaches. I have read all of your csr material and think you have a wonderfully articulated position which I would work daily to implement, making sure anyone feels welcome.
</li>
</ul>
<div class="container row no-gutters-desktop deub" height="300"></div>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I am an ideal candidate because I have <small>(experience)</small></h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
<li>
Community building - captain of a 100+ gender mixed ultimate program in Dallas. Host several hundred attendee USAU tournaments, whose HQ moved from Boulder to Denver last year.
</li>
<li>
Marketing, comm, and pr - I have worked to make money for pr firms, digital media agencies, creative agencies, and freelancers. This is my realm and I will run the whole mountain south region if your corporate structure does not have someone overseeing all of those contacts.
</li>
<li>
Local scene experience - A mentor once taught me to look for great stories and try and bring those to life in events. That is more important than ever in tech because the stories are difficult to identify and the heroes harder to see. I can make the local coders feel like heroes. 
</li>
<li>
Ability to work a room - Last summer I convinced two clubs that hated each other, consisting of stubborn employed adults, to compete together. Almost all of empathy is understanding someone else's concern and experience, which is why I am a feminist and so gosh darn upset about the environment. If we do not think of others around us, we are stomping around blind and reckless.
</li>
<li>
Business growth, long term and immediate strategy - As a director of marketing my role was to forecast and project sales and a coordinator oversaw openings of several new $50,000+ grand openings. If you want someone who both sweats the first few weeks when the margins are not squeaking yet and has the gumption to make a solution happen we are speaking the same language.
</li>
<li>
Lifelong learning - Every age should have an interest in programming and development. Likewise, everyone should have an interest in their own bodily health and sound mind. This is why I encourage friendly competitions like spades and sports. 
</li>
<li>
Influence across the company - Hey, as much as you want me to influence I would love. Whoever wants to work together on a best practice, I am open doors and my city would be welcoming to colleagues. Likewise, I would love to travel and collaborate in other markets.
</li>
<li>
Strong public speaking - My sophomore year of high school I joined our future business leaders of america club, and on the first meeting was subsequently elected president using the false alias bruce welcing. My category of competition was extemperaneous speech. In the years after I left, the program went on to major national showings. No one cares about that, but rattling off crowd sensitive patter is what I have been training for my entire life. Book me for conferences, get me a stage, and I will generate leads.
<li>
Balance of priorities - At Red Bull, our kickoff parties would tend to run late on Friday and very late on Saturday. It was a test to make sure the new brand ambassadors would still be at the table seven am. For the past seven years I have been dating a salesforce developer named Lauren Thomas, and we are relocating to Colorado together. In the same way Red Bull cultivated a party hard work hard balance, I want Colorado to be a building balance for myself and her. Expect me to put in huge amounts of lifting to make something great, but if I need a vacation it does not need to be emails each morning. I believe in <a name="Range"></a> unplugging from the code every now and then.
</li>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="container row no-gutters-desktop deub" height="300"></div>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Here are the<small> (range) </small> skills you requested</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
<li>
Startup experience - Web boutique startup, full-time, capstone in iterative development and business canvassing.
</li>
<li>
Success in academic sales - No, but I love academia and have a great relationship with educators at the high school and collegiate level nationally.
</li>
<li>
Experience in a tech bootcamp - Very close, my academic background includes nine weeks of dormed in academic camps, two years of housed high school and a captivated culture of pedantry.
</li>
<li>
Salesforce experience - CRM platform utilized at yp marketing solutions. I was the guy everyone came to when you looking for reports and sales entries.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I firmly believe that technology can make the world a better place if we are thoughtful stewards of our responsibilities. Part of sustainability principles include designing opportunities for the world to iterate for the better easily, while safeguarding against mistakes. This position, if you think I am a good fit, will enable me to make impactful changes for the students and employers connected to dev bootcamp in Boulder.
